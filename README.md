Onedark Custom Theme For Logseq

## Using custom.css

The easiest way to adopt this theme is to use jsDelivr CDN by adding the following line to your custom.css. You can also change the @main part to use the latest version.

``` css
/* This must be the first line of the custom.css with other import rules */
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hantaotaohan/logseq-onedark/custom.css");
```

Alternatively, you can download this repo and load it as a Logseq Theme Plugin.
